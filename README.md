# 🚀 30 Days, 30 JavaScript Projects

The projects are taken from <a href="https://youtu.be/WoNmm4YS8e4" target="_blank">this video</a>.

The goal is to at least make one project a day so that the challenge can be done in 30 days, but my focus will be to try to complete more than one a day if it seems easy, specially the beginner level projects. also this is a funny cat image:
